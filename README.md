# Vodanation_Internship_Project
As part of my Vodanation Internship in the data analytics department, specifically CVM Analytics, I was tasked with cleaning a dataset about movies provided by my mentor
The main problem that i had to tackle in this internship was that i had never encountered a JSON Array in columns in a dataset before.
<h1>Purpose of Project</h1>
<p>The purpose of this project was to clean the csv file and break down the JSON Arrays in whichever format I thought was best, then i had to import data into MYsql and generate insights that answered multiple questions as well as generate my own creative insights</p>

<h1>Resources</h1>
TMDB dataset on git project folder

<h2>Questions to be answered : </h2>
<ul>
  <li>Each original language and the most popular film in each</li>
  <li>number of movies for each genre</li>
  <li>Movie Insights by year/li>
  <li>Movies Return on investments (ROI)</li>
  <li>Revenue by amount of genres</li>

</ul>
